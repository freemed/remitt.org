**REMITT** uses the GPL.

The reference implementation for a **REMITT** client is currently implemented in **[FreeMED](http://github.com/freemed/freemed)** (using [PHP](http://www.php.net/)), which carries a GPL license.

Any further questions should be directed to the [FreeMED Software Foundation](http://freemedsoftware.org/).
